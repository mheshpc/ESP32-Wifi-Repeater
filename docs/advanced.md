## Advanced configuration

![image](advanced.png)

The settings under advanced configuration are well explained in the UI. 

## Resetting the device/ Erasing the flash

All settings can be wiped in the UI with the "Erase Flash"-Button. If any misconfiguration leads to an unusable device you can also connect GPIO 23 to ground on startup to reset the device copmpletely. The GND- and the GPIO 23-Pin are normally direct neighbours, so you can bridge them by any metallic object, like a paper clip, knife, small wire, ... If you want to reset, you have to power off the device, bridge the GND and GPIO 23 and power on the device. After 5s with bridged connection, the device is resetted and you can remove the bridge and restart the device. If on your board is an indicator LED available, these will flash fast during this process. 

## Interpreting the on board LED

If the ESP32 is connected to the upstream AP then the on board LED should be on, otherwise off.
If there are devices connected to the ESP32 then the on board LED will keep blinking as many times as the number of devices connected.

For example:

One device connected to the ESP32, and the ESP32 is connected to upstream: 

`*****.*****`

Two devices are connected to the ESP32, but the ESP32 is not connected to upstream: 

`....*.*....`

## Command Line Interface

For configuration you have to use a serial console (Putty or GtkTerm with 115200 bps).
Use the "set_sta" and the "set_ap" command to configure the WiFi settings. Changes are stored persistently in NVS and are applied after next restart. Use "show" to display the current config. The NVS namespace for the parameters is "esp32_nat"

Enter the `help` command get a full list of all available commands:

# DNS
As soon as the ESP32 STA has learned a DNS IP from its upstream DNS server on first connect, it passes that to newly connected clients.
Before that by default the DNS-Server which is offerd to clients connecting to the ESP32 AP is set to 192.168.4.1 and sets up a [Captive portal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captive_portal). All DNS (http) resolutions will be resolved to 192.168.4.1 itself, so any input will lead to the start page.
