# ESP32-Wifi-Repeater

This is an extension of the great work of [martin-ger's ESP32 NAT Router-project](https://github.com/martin-ger/esp32_nat_router) and [dchristl's esp32_nat_router_extended](https://github.com/dchristl/esp32_nat_router_extended). I used their projects as a starting point for learning microcontroller programming and extended it with some features. 

## Features / Usage scenarios
- Extend range of WiFi network (Repeater)
- Additional network for guests
- Portable usage with a small, low power device (battery powered)
- [Bypass restrictions](docs/advanced.md#advanced-configuration) in public WiFis, like device and rate limit
- Scanning for APs (s. [limitations](#wifi-scanning-limitation))
- User friendly UI with mobile support
- [Resetting the device](docs/advanced.md#resetting-the-device-erasing-the-flash) in UI and with Pin/Button
